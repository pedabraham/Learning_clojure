# Clojure basics

There was a point in time when I believe I could read any programming without a lot confusion, this was before I discover languages with different structures like Clojure.
Clojure is language in which everything is a function, and use parenthesis, to call this functions:
In the expression `(+ 2 3)` + is the name of a function and the numbers 2 and 3 are the parameters.

The types in Clojure are the same of java, but you don’t have to specify the type if you don’t want, by default a natural number in a long, and a number with floating point is a double, you  can cast a number by types like float or int. A nice feature of Clojure is that integer overflown is not thing in Clojure but when you go beyond the limits an error is raised, if you want a really big number you have to use another type big Int. You also have string, booleans, vectors and maps (which are like python dictionaries), a map is declared using brackets `{key value}`, you can access the value of a map in this way (get {key value} key), or in this way `(key {key value})`, but in this case the key has to be an string for a more understandable map, is recommended to ad : to the key, for example `{:j 9}`. 

In clojure you can use two kinds of forms to define a value, when you use `(let [x 8])` you using the value 8 to x, this value can be changed and only can be use in the expression inside the definition of the let or scope. The other kind is using def in the expression `(def x 8)` you can access to x outside the scope of declaration. 
To declare a function you use fn like this `(fn [x y] x +  y)` this is just a function but can’t be accessed in other parts of the code for that you have to use, `(def name (fn [x y] ( + x y)))`,
But you can mix this two expression by doing this `(defn name [x y] (+ x y)))`.
