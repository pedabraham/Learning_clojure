# Mario

After a long time since my last attempt to learn clojure I tried a different approach. This time I'm going to do small projects. As a cs50 former student I already completed the projects of the course in languages like c and python, this asigments are great because they design to build layer of computer thinking and they are a perfect opportunity to translate the ideas of my previous knowledge in a new syntax.

The objective of Mario is to display a mario like tower with spaces and hashes.

For this I start by creating a function to get each line, I use a for loop and a if to get an space or a hash, to get to this it wasn't straightforward, first i thought in setting a string and append each element, but it wasn't so easy so I needed to use a for anyway and remember that the for is still a function, with something to return so I put all the logic in the for and after that join all the elements of the array, which btw it wasn't an array it was a lazy sequence.

Then i created the logic for all the lines and used another "for" and inside the this I called my function getline, at the end I had all the lines and I just needed to print it, so i just used a printline for each sequence.

Mario can be found on [cs50_clojure/mario.cljs](https://github.com/pedabraham/Learning_clojure/blob/main/cs50_clojure/mario.cljs)
